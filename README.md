# Luno Node Sample App

This is a sample app for [Luno](https://luno.io) using Express. It demonstrates how to set up a barebones application using Luno's User Management API.

## Setup

Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.

## Boot

```sh
KEY=API_KEY SECRET=API_SECRET node src/app
```

Set `API_KEY` and `API_SECRET` to valid API credentials. If you'd like to use the sample app in Sandbox mode (recommended if you're just testing things out), add `SANDBOX=true`.
